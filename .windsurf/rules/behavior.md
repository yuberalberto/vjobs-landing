# Project-Specific Behavior - VJobs Landing

<conservative_approach>
## Conservative Development
Do not create new folders, routes, endpoints, or components unless explicitly requested.

This project prefers:
- Explicit user requests over assumptions
- Minimal changes over extensive refactoring
- Asking before creating new structure
- Working within existing architecture
</conservative_approach>

<change_proposals>
## When Proposing Changes
- Prefer the simplest approach that matches existing conventions
- If there are multiple valid approaches, propose up to 2 options and ask which to choose
- Always explain the trade-offs of each approach
- Wait for explicit approval before implementing
</change_proposals>
