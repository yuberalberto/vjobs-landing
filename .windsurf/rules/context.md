# Project Context - VJobs Landing

<project_stack>
## Stack

## Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel (deployment, serverless functions)

<responsive_breakpoints>

Use these only. Do not invent new ones.
- Desktop: >992
- Tablet: 768 to 992

- Small mobile: <=576
</responsive_breakpoints>

<project_tracking>
## Tracking
Single source of truth: `docs-project/features_tracker.md`

Rules:
- Update it only after explicit user confirmation
- Never mark a task as done unless the user accepts it
- Preserve IDs and structure
- Do not renumber or reorganize unless told
</project_tracking>

<documentation_scope>
## Docs scope
- Treat `docs-project/archive/` as historical reference only
- Prefer current docs unless the user asks otherwise
- When in doubt, ask which documentation version to use
</documentation_scope>
